# Git and GitHub 28 and 29 OCT Assignment.
## Q.1 Explain what version control is and its importance in software development.
- Version control is one of the crucial part of the software development. It helps user to track his status of the development and help to trace back work he had done so far. It also helps to create revisions of his work. This help if anything goes south during software development, it usually it does, user can go back to the older file and start again. Basically version control is the chronicle copies of the work what had been done so far. 
## Q.2 Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository.
- **Git work Flow Stage-wise**
    1. Working Directory (File creation / Work Update)
        - When files are in working director we can either create the new files or make the changes to the existing files. this stage is the first stage of the git and git hub. 
    2. Use **Git add** Command
        - Use git command to reach to the staging area.
    3. Staging area
        - Staging is the area between the changes where we are ready to commit the changes. In layman's term we can say that before boarding the train we are standing at the platform. Basically we are selecting the file what are ready to commit. Files at this stage will only selected. 
    4. Use **Git Commit** Command
        - After committing the files we are sending the files in to repo (repository).
    5. Repository (Repo)
        - When files are in repo it is the milestone if we want to restore the data we can restore the data from this stage. If we want to make changes in this file git will make a new version of it and follow the stages for the working directory. However from this stage we can also send files to remote file hosting service like github.
## Q.3 Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control.
- If there are any files what are sensitive, or file we do not want to track we can make the .gitignore file and mention the names of the files in it. git will ignore those file completely and will not cover it in the version flow. 
## Q.4 Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some alternatives to GitHub.
## Q.5 Describe the process of contributing to any open-source project on GitHub in a step-by-step manner.
## Q.6 Deploy Tailwind projects named Youtube, slack, and Gmail clones on GitHub pages and share the deployed link of those three. Expected output - Live hosted URL Link of your deployed respective website with GitHub pages.
