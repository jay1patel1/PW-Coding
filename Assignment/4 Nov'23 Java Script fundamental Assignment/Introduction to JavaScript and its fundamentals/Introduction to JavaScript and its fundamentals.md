# JavaScript in Web Development

## 1. What is JavaScript and its Role in Web Development?

- JavaScript is a programming language that initially ran in browsers and now operates in local machine environments like Node.js.
- Its role in web development is to provide logic, creating an environment for data storage and program execution.

## 2. Key Differences Between JavaScript and HTML

### Differences:

- JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language, while HTML is solely a markup language.
- JavaScript provides logic, whereas HTML is limited to structuring data.

### Where to Use:

- HTML is employed for structuring content or text on the web. For example, displaying a greeting like "Welcome to the site" is done using HTML.
- JavaScript is applied when logic is needed. For instance, designing a calculator involves using HTML and CSS for visible elements and JavaScript for calculation logic.

## 3. Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

- There are 7 primitive data types:

1. **String:**
   - Any data with text or text + number, e.g., "123WER" or let name = "123".

2. **Number:**
   - Numerical data, e.g., "123".

3. **Boolean:**
   - Represents true or false, e.g., let willYouEatFood = true.

4. **Undefined:**
   - When a variable is declared but not assigned, e.g., let name;.

5. **Null:**
   - Intentionally blank value, e.g., let name = null.

6. **Symbol:**
   - Represents something unique, e.g., let uniqueSymbol = Symbol("unique").

7. **BigInt:**
   - Represents a large number.

## 4. Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript

- Declaring variables allows storing various data types (string, number, function, array, object, etc.).
- It's like a chapter in a book, pointing to data with a title in an index.

b. Example of declaring variables with the "let" keyword:

```javascript
let name = "Jay";
let number = 123;
let array = [23, 24, 21, 34];
let greetingsString = "Goodbye";
