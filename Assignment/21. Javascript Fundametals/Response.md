## Q1. Write a JavaScript function called outerFunction that takes a parameter and returns an inner function. The inner function should access both the parameter of outerFunction and a variable declared within outerFunction. Demonstrate how lexical scoping allows the inner function to maintain access to these variables even after outerFunction has finished executing.
